# playingaround
I'm going through the steps of creating a repository and merging a branch to the master branch. 
so this is where the code goes!
I suppose I'll be coding in Node.js since that is how Pokemon Showdown is coded.
So the next logical step would be to look at the Pokemon Showdown developers section and just sort of see what kind of projects that they are working on. 
I feel somewhat drawn -- I know that I don't want to go to medical school now, and I know that I want to learn coding now. And yet, I am thinking of spending the majority of my time studying for the MCAT and trying to get a good grade in my biology lab out of a fear of someone looking at my grades and thinking "Hmm, his grades aren't that good."
THe most sensible thing for me to do would be to drop the class and focus more of my energies on coding. 
But at the same time, I enjoy the benefits of having some sort of schedule. And there's also the emotional benefits of my parents not being too mad.

So the emotional turbulence that I feel is a result of the cognitive dissonance between my intent and my actions. I want to code, I want to exercise, and I can do all these things while jumping through the hoops in medicine. It just doesn't feel good to split my energies to a task that I personally feel is useless. 
Which means that the lack of autonomy is taking an emotional toll on me. Role strain or conflict, i'm not sure which one. On one hand, I am a son and a dependent, so I am expected to do what my caretakers expect of me.
And so I express my autonomy in other ways...sublimation? 
Whatever, rambling at this point.
